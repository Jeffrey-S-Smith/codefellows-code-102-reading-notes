Hello I am *Jeffrey Smith*

### Growth Mindset

I believe it is any individuals talents or skills which can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others.

#### Three reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset.

1. Face your challenges bravely
2. Stop seeking approval from others
3. Take a step deeper into authenticity
