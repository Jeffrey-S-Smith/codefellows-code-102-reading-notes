### What is a wireframe?

It is a architectural blueprint, a wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app.
ireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, 
styling, color, and graphics are kept to a minimum.

### What is the purpose of wireframing?

Wireframes serve three key purposes: They keep the concept user-focused, they clarify and define website features, and they are quick and cheap to create. Let’s take a look at 
each of these purposes in more detail.

### What are the different types of wireframes?

There are three main types of wireframes: low-fidelity wireframes, mid-fidelity 
wireframes, and high-fidelity wireframes. The most significant distinguishing factor between 
these wireframes is the amount of detail they contain.

Low-fidelity wireframes
Mid-fidelity wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes

### HTML basics

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure 
a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic 
understanding of HTML and its functions.

So what is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  
For example, take the following line of content:

My cat is very grumpy

If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph 
by enclosing it in paragraph tags:

<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>

Semantics

n programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of 
code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or 
"what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look 
at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. 
Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text 
it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
